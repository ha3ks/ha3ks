## About Me 

Hi I'm Dan, you may know me from many popular internet websites such as [Twitter/X](https://x.com/ha3ks), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ha3ks.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/accountreset).

I 'work' in the Computer/Networking/Security field, I have a lot of experience and wear many hats (mainly to hide the bald patches). I dabble in programming, currently [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and I am known for debunking a lot of the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) marketing that companies or people do, so much so that I have been awarded for this and received various thanks and challenge coins from suppliers/companies #swag

I guess you could say I am in it for the long run and I like to help others along the way be it directly or by sharing my experiences and knowledge via [the blog](https://www.ha3ks.com/).

I encourage you to share, help grow open source and protect your data.

# Nerd Stats

Yeah I know it isn't much, a lot of my work is not tracked via GitHub activity.
